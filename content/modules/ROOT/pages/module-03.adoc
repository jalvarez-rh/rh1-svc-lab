== Module Goals

The goal of this lab is to learn about the features from the Trusted Software Supply Chain suite of products from Red Hat. In sovereign cloud environments, maintaining control over your software supply chain is essential. This module demonstrates how cryptographic signing, verification, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) enable you to maintain sovereignty over your software artifacts and dependencies.

[[setup]]

== Setup

First, we need to set up the applications for this module.

TIP: Run the following command to ensure the environment is up to date and study up on the software supply chain concepts while it's running.

[[trusted-artifact-signer]]

== Trusted Artifact Signer

In sovereign cloud environments, maintaining verifiable control over software artifacts is critical for ensuring that only approved, audited code runs in your infrastructure. Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (TAS) enhances software supply chain security by simplifying cryptographic signing and verification of software artifacts, such as container images, binaries, and documents.

Trusted Artifact Signer provides a production-ready deployment of the https://www.sigstore.dev/[Sigstore project] as a core component of the Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain product family. This enables organizations to maintain sovereignty over their software supply chain by ensuring all artifacts are cryptographically signed, verifiable, and auditable.

=== Why Trusted Artifact Signer?

In sovereign cloud environments, maintaining control over your software supply chain is essential for regulatory compliance, data protection, and operational independence. Trusted Artifact Signer addresses these requirements through:

. *Supply Chain Security*: Modern software development requires robust mechanisms to secure dependencies and artifacts, which GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) (https://www.gnupg.org/) struggles to address effectively. For sovereign cloud operations, this ensures only approved, verified artifacts enter your infrastructure.
. *Usability*: Developers need simpler, more intuitive signing solutions without the burden of manual key management. This reduces operational overhead while maintaining strict security controls essential for sovereign environments.
. *Transparency*: A centralized, tamper-evident log system ensures accountability and traceability of signatures, enhancing trust and providing the auditability required for sovereign cloud compliance.
. *Modern Identity Integration*: Sigstore aligns with contemporary authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect), making it easier to tie signatures to identities within your organization's identity management systems—critical for maintaining sovereign control.
. *Automation*: Sigstore fits seamlessly into automated CI/CD workflows, which are critical in modern software development pipelines. This enables consistent enforcement of signing policies across your sovereign infrastructure without manual intervention.

==== Advantages of Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer over GPG

Sigstore is designed to address the pain points and limitations of GPG in the context of modern software development, focusing on ease of use, transparency, and security for signing and verifying software artifacts. For sovereign cloud environments, Trusted Artifact Signer provides the additional benefit of enabling complete operational control over your signing infrastructure.

* Enables sovereign control by allowing organizations to operate signing services within their own infrastructure boundaries.
* Eliminates manual key management.
* Provides automated, identity-based signing.
* Ensures transparency with central (optionally public) logs.
* Simplifies adoption with developer-friendly tools.
* Reduces risks from long-term private key compromises.
* Aligns with modern software practices and supply chain security requirements.

== Signing Our Software

For signing and verification of container images, we'll be using the `cosign` CLI binary, which has already been installed on your bastion host (and can also be downloaded from the OpenShift Console).

`cosign` can easily be used in any CI/CD toolchain as we use it here and handles all the communication with the Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer services that request certificates, handle the OIDC authentication, store info in the transparency log (Rekor), etc.

[[signing-verifying-container-image]]

=== Signing and Verifying a Container Image

In sovereign cloud environments, cryptographic signing ensures that only approved, verified container images can be deployed to your infrastructure. This maintains control over your software supply chain and enables compliance with regulatory requirements for software provenance and integrity.

`cosign` will be interacting with the image in our private registry, therefore we need to log in to Quay.

*Procedure*

. Run the following command in the terminal:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign login https://$QUAY_URL -u $QUAY_USER -p {quay_admin_password}
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

        Note that there may be personally identifiable information associated with this signed artifact.
        This may include the email address associated with the account with which you authenticate.

error opening browser: exec: "xdg-open": executable file not found in $PATH
Go to the following link in a browser:

         https://keycloak-rhsso.apps.cluster-l2ktc.l2ktc.sandbox75.opentlc.com/auth/realms/openshift/protocol/openid-connect/auth?access_type=online&client_id=trusted-artifact-signer&code_challenge=JHFlN4cLdRCGJWjkGf1S1nKYO9Nc-bnC6bhwkZXoS3M&code_challenge_method=S256&nonce=2qDckQCVBACjnviJ8bdxIWwPh1r&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&scope=openid+email&state=2qDckRnXkzmspwUHxF3f6K3NX67
Enter verification code:

----

NOTE: As mentioned above, the signing process ties an identity (an OIDC identity, to be specific) to the signature. The signing certificate is issued on demand, but *only issued if an OIDC identity proof can be established*.

In this example, the "OAuth2 browser-based flow" is used. In other words, you will authenticate to the OIDC system by user and password via a browser login. We are running `cosign` in an `ssh` session with no connection to your system, therefore the check for a browser to open the login page fails: `error opening browser: exec: "xdg-open": executable file not found in $PATH`.

TIP: As an alternative to the browser flow, you can use direct access grants (password grant) to get an OIDC token first, then pass it to cosign with `--identity-token=$OIDC_TOKEN`. See the example later in this module for details.

[start=4]
. Copy the URL and paste it in a new browser window or tab and log in—use one of the following user credentials:

[cols="2,2"]
|===
| *Username:* | *jdoe@redhat.com* or *user1* or *admin*
| *Password:* | *secure* (for jdoe) or *116608* (for user1/admin)
|===

NOTE: You can use any of the created users (jdoe, user1, or admin) to sign images. The username can be entered as the username (e.g., `user1`) or email address (e.g., `user1@demo.redhat.com`).

image::11-quay-signed-image.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

You might be wondering how a pipeline task authenticates itself, since it can't open a browser to log in. Trusted Artifact Signer / Sigstore (including the cosign tool) doesn't authenticate the user directly. Instead, it relies on the OIDC system to authenticate the request before issuing a signing certificate. This allows the full flexibility of OIDC systems for authentication.

For example, GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD can pass the OIDC identity of the pipeline runner via OIDC tokens into the pipeline.

In general, continuous integration (CI) systems focus on providing the identity of the build or deployment environment rather than the personal identity of the user who triggered it. This helps maintain least privilege and ensures reproducibility.

However, depending on your CI setup and requirements, you can leverage the flexibility of OIDC to meet your specific needs.

**EXAMPLE**

In our workshop environment, we are using Keycloak as SSO / OIDC system. We can request a short-lived OIDC token from Keycloak and use this for authentication (and therefore, *signing* of the image).

1) First, we need to get the OIDC token issuer endpoint from Keycloak:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE=$(curl -s $OIDC_ISSUER_URL | jq -r '.["token-service"]')/token
echo $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ export OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE=$(curl -s $OIDC_ISSUER_URL | jq -r '.["token-service"]')/token
echo $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE
https://keycloak-rhsso.apps.cluster-l2ktc.l2ktc.sandbox75.opentlc.com/auth/realms/openshift/protocol/openid-connect/token
----

2) Now, we are requesting a token from that endpoint for our signing user. You can use any of the created users (jdoe, user1, or admin):

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
# Using jdoe user
export OIDC_TOKEN=$(curl -s --request POST --url $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=password' --data 'client_id=trusted-artifact-signer' --data 'username=jdoe@redhat.com'  --data 'password=secure' --data 'scope=openid email' | jq -r '.["access_token"]')

# Or using user1 user (alternative)
# export OIDC_TOKEN=$(curl -s --request POST --url $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=password' --data 'client_id=trusted-artifact-signer' --data 'username=user1'  --data 'password=116608' --data 'scope=openid email' | jq -r '.["access_token"]')

echo $OIDC_TOKEN
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ export OIDC_TOKEN=$(curl -s --request POST --url $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=password' --data 'client_id=trusted-artifact-signer' --data 'username=jdoe@redhat.com'  --data 'password=secure' --data 'scope=openid email' | jq -r '.["access_token"]')
echo $OIDC_TOKEN
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cC...
...IgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJl
----

WARNING: This is just an example—naturally, in your own CI system, you would not use the username and password of the signing user in clear text. Rather, you would store them in a Kubernetes Secret or in a Vault. Or, depending on your setup, you already have the pipeline user's OIDC token as an environment variable during your pipeline run. Additionally, you wouldn't echo the token so it doesn't show in logs—even though it might only be short-lived, this is not a good practice.

3) Now that we have the token, we can pass that to `cosign` for authentication:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign sign -y --identity-token=$OIDC_TOKEN $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:1.0
----

==== Verifying Signatures

Verifying an image signature is even easier than signing:

*Procedure*

. Run the following command:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign verify --certificate-identity jdoe@redhat.com $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 | jq
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ cosign verify --certificate-identity jdoe@redhat.com $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 | jq

Verification for quay-lpv5s.apps.cluster-lpv5s.lpv5s.sandbox1300.opentlc.com/quayadmin/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
[
  {
    "critical": {
      "identity": {
        "podman-reference": "quay-lpv5s.apps.cluster-lpv5s.lpv5s.sandbox1300.opentlc.com/quayadmin/patient-portal-frontend"
      },
      "image": {
        "podman-manifest-digest": "sha256:9323448ee75bfb5380004038bd04e2d7be5a45707f3895b620e6937aac6ebba7"
      },
      "type": "cosign container image signature"
    },
    "optional": {
      "1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1": "https://keycloak-rhsso.apps.cluster-lpv5s.lpv5s.sandbox1300.opentlc.com/auth/realms/openshift",
...
----

In this case, we are asking `cosign` (and therefore *Trusted Artifact Signer*) to verify if `jdoe@redhat.com` has signed this image. We can also use regular expressions to check if anyone from Red Hat has signed this image, using `--certificate-identity-regexp`:

[start=2]
. Run the following command:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@redhat\.com$ $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 | jq
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@redhat\.com$ $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 | jq

Verification for quay-lpv5s.apps.cluster-lpv5s.lpv5s.sandbox1300.opentlc.com/quayadmin/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
[
  {

      "identity": {
        "podman-reference": "quay-lpv5s.apps.cluster-lpv5s.lpv5s.sandbox1300.opentlc.com/quayadmin/patient-portal-frontend"
      },
      "image": {
        "podman-manifest-digest": "sha256:9323448ee75bfb5380004038bd04e2d7be5a45707f3895b620e6937aac6ebba7"
      },
      "type": "cosign container image signature"
    },
    "optional": {
      "1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1": "https://keycloak-rhsso.apps.cluster-lpv5s.lpv5s.sandbox1300.opentlc.com/auth/realms/openshift",
----

We can also verify that the person (to be correct, the OIDC identity) who signed the image was authenticated against a specific OIDC Issuer (using the `--certificate-oidc-issuer` flag) or against an OIDC Issuer somewhere in our domain:

[start=3]
. Run the following command:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign verify --certificate-identity jdoe@redhat.com --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp \.opentlc\.com $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 | jq
----

NOTE: We are using `jq` for readability in these examples; it is not required.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ cosign verify --certificate-identity jdoe@redhat.com --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp \.opentlc\.com $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 | jq

Verification for quay-l2ktc.apps.cluster-l2ktc.l2ktc.sandbox75.opentlc.com/quayadmin/patient-portal-frontend:1.0 --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates

[[next-steps]]

== The Next Steps 

We didn't have time to cover the following topics in this lab, but they are important to consider for your own environment.

[[signing-verifying-git-commits]]

=== Signing and Verifying Git Commits

Maintaining sovereign control over your codebase requires verifiable proof of authorship and integrity for all code changes. Git commit signing with *Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer* (using gitsign, Fulcio, Rekor, and OIDC via Keycloak) cryptographically ties commits to authenticated identities like jdoe@redhat.com—without managing key pairs. Configure git locally for automatic signing on commits/tags (e.g., from VSCode), distinguishing mutable committer metadata from immutable signer identity in the transparency log.

Verify with `gitsign verify --certificate-identity='*redhat.com'` (regex for team policies) against Rekor and trust roots. This establishes signed, identity-associated, witnessed artifacts for images/commits, ensuring auditability and traceability in sovereign clouds.

[[trusted-profile-analyzer]]
== Trusted Profile Analyzer

The Trusted Profile Analyzer adds *Software Bills of Materials (SBOM)* management to OpenShift for visibility/control over dependencies in sovereign clouds. An SBOM is a "nested inventory of software components" (per CISA.gov), essential for compliance, data residency, and supply chain decisions.

Regulations like U.S. EO 14028 (mandatory SBOMs for federal vendors), EU Cyber Resilience Act, FDA guidance, OWASP SCVS, CISA BOD 23-01, ISO/IEC 5962, and proposed SEC rules increasingly mandate/recommend SBOMs for transparency, risk management, and vulnerability tracking. In sovereign operations, SBOMs ensure all components meet security/regulatory standards, reducing risks while maintaining independence.

[[module-cleanup]]

== Module Cleanup

Once you're done with this module, kindly execute the following command to reset the content, variables, repositories, etc. for the next user:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-tssc-tmm/security-roadshow/main/cleanup_tssc-module.sh | bash -s {quay_admin_username} {quay_admin_password}
----

You're crushing it!
