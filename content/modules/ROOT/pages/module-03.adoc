== Module Goals

The goal of this lab is to learn about the features from the Trusted Software Supply Chain suite of products from Red Hat. In sovereign cloud environments, maintaining control over your software supply chain is essential. This module demonstrates how cryptographic signing, verification, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) enable you to maintain sovereignty over your software artifacts and dependencies.

[[setup]]

== Setup

First, we need to set up the applications for this module.

TIP: Run the following command to ensure the environment is up to date and study up on the software supply chain concepts while it's running.

== Trusted Artifact Signer

In sovereign cloud environments, maintaining verifiable control over software artifacts is critical for ensuring that only approved, audited code runs in your infrastructure. Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer (TAS) enhances software supply chain security by simplifying cryptographic signing and verification of software artifacts, such as container images, binaries, and documents.

Trusted Artifact Signer provides a production-ready deployment of the https://www.sigstore.dev/[Sigstore project] as a core component of the Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain product family. This enables organizations to maintain sovereignty over their software supply chain by ensuring all artifacts are cryptographically signed, verifiable, and auditable.

=== Why Trusted Artifact Signer?

In sovereign cloud environments, maintaining control over your software supply chain is essential for regulatory compliance, data protection, and operational independence. Trusted Artifact Signer addresses these requirements through:

. *Supply Chain Security*: Modern software development requires robust mechanisms to secure dependencies and artifacts, which GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) (https://www.gnupg.org/) struggles to address effectively. For sovereign cloud operations, this ensures only approved, verified artifacts enter your infrastructure.
. *Usability*: Developers need simpler, more intuitive signing solutions without the burden of manual key management. This reduces operational overhead while maintaining strict security controls essential for sovereign environments.
. *Transparency*: A centralized, tamper-evident log system ensures accountability and traceability of signatures, enhancing trust and providing the auditability required for sovereign cloud compliance.
. *Modern Identity Integration*: Sigstore aligns with contemporary authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect), making it easier to tie signatures to identities within your organization's identity management systems—critical for maintaining sovereign control.
. *Automation*: Sigstore fits seamlessly into automated CI/CD workflows, which are critical in modern software development pipelines. This enables consistent enforcement of signing policies across your sovereign infrastructure without manual intervention.

==== Advantages of Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer over GPG

Sigstore is designed to address the pain points and limitations of GPG in the context of modern software development, focusing on ease of use, transparency, and security for signing and verifying software artifacts. For sovereign cloud environments, Trusted Artifact Signer provides the additional benefit of enabling complete operational control over your signing infrastructure.

* Enables sovereign control by allowing organizations to operate signing services within their own infrastructure boundaries.
* Eliminates manual key management.
* Provides automated, identity-based signing.
* Ensures transparency with central (optionally public) logs.
* Simplifies adoption with developer-friendly tools.
* Reduces risks from long-term private key compromises.
* Aligns with modern software practices and supply chain security requirements.

[[signing-our-software]]

== Signing our software

For signing and verification of container images, we'll be using the `cosign` CLI binary, which has already been installed on your bastion host (and can also be downloaded from the OpenShift Console).

`cosign` can easily be used in any CI/CD toolchain as we use it here and handles all the communication with the Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer services that request certificates, handle the OIDC authentication, store info in the transparency log (Rekor), etc.

=== Signing and Verifying a Container Image

In sovereign cloud environments, cryptographic signing ensures that only approved, verified container images can be deployed to your infrastructure. This maintains control over your software supply chain and enables compliance with regulatory requirements for software provenance and integrity.

`cosign` will be interacting with the image in our private registry, therefore we need to log in to Quay.

*Procedure*

. Run the following command in the terminal:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign login $QUAY_URL -u $QUAY_USER -p {quay_admin_password}
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ cosign login $QUAY_URL -u $QUAY_USER -p MzI2OTI0
auth.go:203: logged in via /home/lab-user/.podman/config.json
----

[start=2]
. Run the following command in the terminal:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign tree $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:0.1
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

        Note that there may be personally identifiable information associated with this signed artifact.
        This may include the email address associated with the account with which you authenticate.
        This information will be used for signing this artifact and will be stored in public transparency logs and cannot be removed later.

Go to the following link in a browser:

Enter verification code:

----

NOTE: As mentioned above, the signing process ties an identity (an OIDC identity, to be specific) to the signature. The signing certificate is issued on demand, but *only issued if an OIDC identity proof can be established*.

In this example, the "OAuth2 browser-based flow" is used. In other words, you will authenticate to the OIDC system by user and password via a browser login. We are running `cosign` in an `ssh` session with no connection to your system, therefore the check for a browser to open the login page fails: `error opening browser: exec: "xdg-open": executable file not found in $PATH`.

image::11-quay-signed-image.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

You might be wondering how a pipeline task authenticates itself, since it can't open a browser to log in. Trusted Artifact Signer / Sigstore (including the cosign tool) doesn't authenticate the user directly. Instead, it relies on the OIDC system to authenticate the request before issuing a signing certificate. This allows the full flexibility of OIDC systems for authentication.

For example, GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD can pass the OIDC identity of the pipeline runner via OIDC tokens into the pipeline.

In general, continuous integration (CI) systems focus on providing the identity of the build or deployment environment rather than the personal identity of the user who triggered it. This helps maintain least privilege and ensures reproducibility.

However, depending on your CI setup and requirements, you can leverage the flexibility of OIDC to meet your specific needs.

**EXAMPLE**

In our workshop environment, we are using Keycloak as SSO / OIDC system. We can request a short-lived OIDC token from Keycloak and use this for authentication (and therefore, *signing* of the image).

1) First, we need to get the OIDC token issuer endpoint from Keycloak:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE=$(curl -s $OIDC_ISSUER_URL | jq -r '.["token-service"]')/token
echo $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ export OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE=$(curl -s $OIDC_ISSUER_URL | jq -r '.["token-service"]')/token
echo $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE
https://keycloak-rhsso.apps.cluster-l2ktc.l2ktc.sandbox75.opentlc.com/auth/realms/openshift/protocol/openid-connect/token
----

2) Now, we are requesting a token from that endpoint for our signing user.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export OIDC_TOKEN=$(curl -s --request POST --url $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=password' --data 'client_id=trusted-artifact-signer' --data 'username=jdoe@redhat.com'  --data 'password=secure' --data 'scope=openid email' | jq -r '.["access_token"]')
echo $OIDC_TOKEN
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ export OIDC_TOKEN=$(curl -s --request POST --url $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=password' --data 'client_id=trusted-artifact-signer' --data 'username=jdoe@redhat.com'  --data 'password=secure' --data 'scope=openid email' | jq -r '.["access_token"]')
echo $OIDC_TOKEN
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cC...
...IgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJl
----

WARNING: This is just an example—naturally, in your own CI system, you would not use the username and password of the signing user in clear text. Rather, you would store them in a Kubernetes Secret or in a Vault. Or, depending on your setup, you already have the pipeline user's OIDC token as an environment variable during your pipeline run. Additionally, you wouldn't echo the token so it doesn't show in logs—even though it might only be short-lived, this is not a good practice.

3) Now that we have the token, we can pass that to `cosign` for authentication:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign sign -y --identity-token=$OIDC_TOKEN $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/patient-portal-frontend:0.1

=== Signing and Verifying Git Commits

Maintaining sovereign control over your codebase requires verifiable proof of authorship and integrity for all code changes. Git commit signing ensures that all code modifications are cryptographically tied to authenticated identities, providing the auditability and traceability essential for sovereign cloud operations.

TIP: Using traditional commit signing and verification methods required management and distribution of private/public key pairs to developers - a task that can become quite cumbersome for a large number of developers in your organization. With *Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer*, there is no need to issue/distribute/re-issue keys due to lost passwords/maintain a key revocation list etc.

NOTE: If you haven't already done so, please execute the following steps from previous exercises:

1. We need a git repository for git signing, therefore please make sure you have cloned the workshop apps repository as shown here: xref:00-acs-setup-install-navigation.adoc#deploy-the-workshop-apps[Deploy the Workshop Applications]

2. We won't go through setting up the environment for signing and verification (the Trusted Artifact Signer endpoints) again. If you have followed this chapter from the beginning, you have everything configured already. If not, please set the environment variables as shown xref:#setting-up-the-environment-variables[here], followed by a `cosign initialize`

=== Setting up gitsign for commit signing
Configure git to automatically sign commits using gitsign instead of using the CLI directly. This enables automatic signing for all commits and tags, including from IDEs like VSCode. After preparing a local repository and pushing it to a GitLab instance on the cluster, configure git with local settings that enable GPG signing using gitsign as the X.509 program, and specify the Trusted Artifact Signer endpoints (Fulcio, Rekor, and OIDC issuer) along with the client ID. This ensures every commit is automatically signed without manual intervention.

==== Signing commits with OIDC authentication
When making a commit, gitsign triggers an OIDC authentication flow through Keycloak. In an SSH session, it provides a browser URL for manual authentication, similar to container image signing. After authenticating as the signing user (e.g., jdoe@redhat.com), the commit is signed and the signature is recorded in the Rekor transparency log. It's important to distinguish between two identities: the committer (stored in git metadata, easily changed) and the signer (the OIDC-authenticated identity, cryptographically verified and immutable in the transparency log). This allows developers to use different committer identities across git systems while maintaining a consistent, verifiable signing identity.

==== Verifying commit signatures

Verification can be done with git show --show-signature or gitsign show to inspect signature metadata, but these only display information and don't fully verify against the trust root. For proper verification, use gitsign verify, which validates the signature against the Rekor transparency database and certificate claims. You can verify specific identities (e.g., --certificate-identity=jdoe@redhat.com) or use regex patterns to verify broader criteria, such as any Red Hat email address (@redhat.com) authenticated against any OIDC issuer in a specific domain. This provides flexible verification policies suitable for team environments while maintaining strong security guarantees through cryptographic verification and transparency log validation.

=== Summary

By implementing cryptographic signing and verification for container images and Git commits, you've established foundational controls for maintaining sovereign control over your software supply chain. These capabilities ensure that only approved, verified artifacts enter your infrastructure, providing the auditability and traceability required for regulatory compliance and operational independence in sovereign cloud environments.

With keyless signing and verification, both for container images (or any blob, to be exact) and git commits, we have established artifact and commit integrity, security AND traceability - without the need to create, distribute and manage public/private key pairs.

The artifact is now:

* *Signed*: By using a Sigstore client (cosign/gitsign).
* *Associated*: With an identity through the certificate authority (Fulcio).
* *Witnessed*: By recording the signing information in a permanent transparency log (Rekor).

[[trusted-profile-analyzer]]

== Trusted Profile Analyzer

The Trusted Profile Analyzer adds management capabilities for *Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)* to OpenShift. In sovereign cloud environments, SBOMs are essential for maintaining visibility and control over software dependencies, ensuring compliance with data residency requirements, and enabling organizations to make informed decisions about software components that process sensitive data.

=== *What is an SBOM?*

https://www.cisa.gov[CISA.gov] defines an SBOM as "a nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components." https://www.cisa.gov/sbom[¹]

Using SBOMs, you can have a clear vision of everything that goes into your application or what you may have received from vendors, such as Red Hat. This enables platform engineers to more easily enforce operational controls and compliance across hybrid multi-cloud environments. For sovereign cloud operations, SBOMs provide the transparency needed to ensure all software components meet regulatory requirements, maintain data sovereignty, and enable organizations to maintain complete control over their software supply chain.

In addition, several regulatory requirements and frameworks either *mandate* or *recommend* the use of *Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)* to enhance software supply chain transparency and security. Here are some key examples, but the list is continually growing:

==== *1. U.S. Executive Order 14028 (Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity)*

* *Mandate*: In May 2021, this Executive Order directed the U.S. government to take actions to secure the software supply chain.
* *SBOM Requirement*:
  - The *National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)* was tasked with defining minimum elements for SBOMs.
  - Vendors providing software to federal agencies must provide SBOMs as part of their cybersecurity practices.
  - Goal: Increase transparency about software components to mitigate risks from vulnerabilities.

==== *2. EU Cyber Resilience Act*

* *Proposed Mandate*: Expected to become law in the near future, this act will apply to products with digital elements in the EU.
* *SBOM Requirement*: It encourages or requires organizations to maintain transparency about their software dependencies, including SBOMs, for compliance with security standards.

==== *3. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance*

* *Recommendation*: The FDA issued guidance for medical device manufacturers to include SBOMs.
* *Context*: As part of the *Pre-market Cybersecurity Guidance* for medical devices, manufacturers are encouraged to provide SBOMs to identify vulnerabilities in device software and support risk management.
* *Goal*: Protect healthcare systems and patient safety.

==== *4. OWASP Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS)*

* *Recommendation*: OWASP promotes SBOMs as part of software composition analysis (SCA) to track components and identify vulnerabilities.
* *Context*: Although not a regulatory requirement, it is widely recognized in cybersecurity best practices.

==== *5. CISA Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 23-01*

* *Mandate*: U.S. government agencies are required to track and mitigate known vulnerabilities in software they use.
* *SBOM Role*: Although the directive doesn’t explicitly mandate SBOMs, managing them is critical to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities efficiently.

==== *6. ISO/IEC 5962 (SBOM Standard)*

* *Recommendation*: This international standard formalizes SBOM structure, ensuring consistent implementation across industries. It supports compliance with regulatory and industry standards requiring software transparency.

==== *7. Proposed SEC Cybersecurity Rules*

* *Recommendation*: Companies under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations must report cybersecurity risks, including supply chain vulnerabilities. SBOMs can help meet these transparency requirements.

=== *Why SBOMs are Becoming Standard in Regulations*

* *Transparency*: Knowing what’s in your software reduces the risk of vulnerabilities.
* *Risk Management*: SBOMs help identify, track, and remediate issues in the software supply chain.
* *Compliance*: They demonstrate adherence to evolving cybersecurity and data privacy laws, including requirements for data residency, operational control, and regulatory reporting that are central to sovereign cloud operations.

*As cybersecurity frameworks continue to evolve, the use of SBOMs is increasingly seen as foundational for compliance and risk mitigation. In sovereign cloud environments, SBOMs are essential for maintaining operational independence and ensuring that all software components meet your organization's security and compliance requirements.*
