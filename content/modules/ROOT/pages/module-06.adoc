[[cluster-conformance]]

== Cluster Conformance and Compliance Checks

Ensuring clusters meet conformance standards and compliance requirements is critical for maintaining security and operational consistency across environments.

[[conformance-tests]]

=== Running Conformance Tests

Kubernetes conformance tests verify that clusters meet the Kubernetes API specification and behave consistently.

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Navigate to the RHACM console and select a managed cluster.

[start=2]
. Review cluster conformance status in the cluster details view.

[start=3]
. Navigate to *Governance* → *Policies* to view conformance-related policies.

[start=4]
. Review policy compliance status for conformance requirements:
** API server configuration
** Node configuration
** Network plugin compatibility
** Storage plugin compatibility

[start=5]
. Use RHACM's policy framework to enforce conformance standards:
** Create policies based on Kubernetes conformance requirements
** Apply policies to all managed clusters
