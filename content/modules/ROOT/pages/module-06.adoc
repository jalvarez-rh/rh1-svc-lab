= Assurance

[[cluster-conformance]]

Assurance is critical for sovereignty, ensuring that applications operate in a compliant manner and that clusters maintain compliance across diverse regions and geographies. It is essential to have confidence that compliance reports are accurate, testable, and auditable, thereby supporting and advancing key business objectives. Additionally, enabling teams to collaborate effectively through the use of appropriate tools and technologies helps drive organizational success.

Achieving this level of assurance requires a practical and structured approach.

So let's get practical in our example of an EMEA environment and a US environment. Let's look at practical ways that we can Observe audit Police and manage our clusters and application applications. We will start by looking at the security, compliance and environment insights that we can get from Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS).

== Security and Environment Insights

[[rhacs-insights]]

=== *RHACS Basics*
RHACS provides developers and administrators with tools to meet the security needs of cloud-native development on Kubernetes. Its features address primary security concerns across various environments, including datacenters, private clouds, and public clouds running Kubernetes clusters. With RHACS, you can achieve comprehensive security, covering key areas such as:

*Vulnerability Management*  
Protect nodes, platforms, and applications from vulnerabilities using prioritization and impact-based filters.

*Network Security*

== RHACS Compliance Operator Installation and Compliance Checks

[[conformance-tests]]

Before making changes to your cluster, it’s essential to understand your current compliance posture. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) seamlessly integrates with the OpenShift Compliance Operator to provide out-of-the-box compliance checks—including industry standards such as E8 and DISA STIG. You can also define custom profiles that combine multiple standards into one, streamlining your audit processes and allowing you to easily tailor compliance requirements to your organization or region. This flexibility enables you to create global profiles and maintain consistent, auditable compliance across all OpenShift environments.

=== Checking Your Compliance Posture

The first step to any changes in a cluster is to analyze what you need to change RHACS integrates with the compliance operator to bring you a variety of compliance checks from the E8 to DISA STIG and more. RHACS can also set up custom compliance checks so you can create profiles that have both DISA STIG and E8 standards together for easier auditing and to create a profile that can become global if necessary.

[start=1]
. Click on the *Compliance* -> *OpenShift Schedules*tab.

image::assurance-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Next, click on the *Create scan schdule*.

image::assurance-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
. Next, fill in the form with the following information:

* Name: `acs-catch-all`
* Description: `Daily compliance scan for all profiles covering CIS, E8, Moderate, NERC-CIP, PCI-DSS, and STIG standards for both platform and node-level checks`
* Frequency: *Daily*
* Time: 12:00

. Click Next
. Select the two clusters: *emea-production* and *us-production*
. Click Next
. Add the following profiles (in order):
    * ocp4-cis (99 rules, Platform, Version 1.5.0)
    * ocp4-cis-node (100 rules, Node, Version 1.5.0)
    * ocp4-e8 (14 rules, Platform)
    * ocp4-moderate (136 rules, Platform, Revision 4)
    * ocp4-moderate-node (120 rules, Node, Revision 4)
    * ocp4-nerc-cip (133 rules, Platform)
    * ocp4-nerc-cip-node (120 rules, Node)
    * ocp4-pci-dss (120 rules, Platform, Version 3.2.1)
    * ocp4-pci-dss-node (114 rules, Node, Version 3.2.1)
    * ocp4-stig (50 rules, Platform, Version V2R1)

[start=8]
. Click Next

NOTE: We will not add a delivery destination so we will skip this step. However you can send notifications via email, get details via API or download reports via the console.

[start=9]
. Click Next
. Review your masterpiece and click *Save*

image::assurance-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

You should see the new schedule in the list and it will be performing it's first scan. If you click the 3 dots on the right side of the schedule you can trigger a manual scan, download the report or delete the schedule.

image::assurance-06.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=11]

.Head over to the OpenShift coverage section where you can view all of the details from the scan.

image::assurance-07.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

 The RHACS compliance coverage dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your scan schedules and results. In the Coverage tab, you can review all scan schedules or filter to view specific schedules such as the "acs-catch-all". Each scan displays coverage across a variety of compliance standards—including CIS, OCP, E8, NERC-CIP, NIST 853, PCI-DSS, and DISA-STIG. You can filter results by specific checks for greater detail. On the right side of the dashboard, you’ll see the cluster’s overall compliance status, along with a breakdown of which checks are passing or failing.

=== Analyze Compliance Results

Managing multi-region and multi-geo environments presents specific challenges. Typically, changes are initiated by the operations team, who are responsible for provisioning and managing the infrastructure. They also oversee any modifications needed to enhance security or ensure compliance with applicable standards. Establishing clear processes and leveraging automation can help maintain consistency and compliance across all environments. In OpenShift, cluster changes are done by the administrator or the operations team through the OpenShift console with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) providing the governance and policy capabilities.

=== Make a Simple Cluster Change to Pass the Compliance Check

Let's focus on the ocp4-e8 compliance checks. To pass the `ocp4-e8-ocp-allowed-registries` standard, you need to set an allowlist of container registries that OpenShift can pull images from. 

First let's take a look at the standard;

[start=1]
. Click on the *Compliance* -> *OpenShift Coverage* -> *E8* tab.

image::compliance-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
Let's first check the failing standards by sorting by compliance status.

image::compliance-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
image::compliance-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
. And then clicking on the failing standard 'ocp4-e8-ocp-allowed-registries'.

Here you will see both the clusters impacted by this failing standard and guidance on how to resolve the issue.

[start=4]
. Click on the *Details* tab next to *Results* and review the findings for the failing check. 

To address this, limit the set of container registries that OpenShift is allowed to pull images from by configuring the cluster with a new allowlist. We will do this by applying a YAML configuration as an OpenShift administrator, and then re-scan the cluster to verify compliance.

[start=5]
. Create the Image Configuration YAML by copying and pasting the following into the bastion host terminal.

[source,sh]
----
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Image
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  registrySources:
    allowedRegistries:
      - quay.io
      - registry.redhat.io
      - registry.access.redhat.com
      - image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
      - gcr.io
EOF
----

[TIP]
====
- `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000` is needed for OpenShift’s own internal image registry.
- Add/remove registries as needed for your environment.
- Any registry used in your cluster must be in this list to pass the policy.
====

[start=6]
. Check that your changes have been accepted:

[source,sh]
----
oc get image.config.openshift.io/cluster -o yaml | grep allowedRegistries -A 10
----

**Output**
[source,sh]
----
    allowedRegistries:
    - quay.io
    - registry.redhat.io
    - registry.access.redhat.com
    - image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
    - my-trusted-registry.internal.example.com
    - quay.io
status:
  internalRegistryHostname: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000
----

[start=7]
**Verification**

. To verify remediation and compliance with the `ocp4-e8-ocp-allowed-registries` requirement:

.. Go back to the *RHACS* console.
.. Navigate to *Compliance* → *Scan Schedules* and locate your schedule (for example, `acs-catch-all`).
.. Use the menu on the schedule (three dots) and select "Run scan" to trigger a manual scan.

**Check Results**

[start=8]

.Click on the *Compliance* -> *OpenShift Coverage* -> *E8* tab.

- The `ocp4-e8-ocp-allowed-registries` check should now pass, showing your registry restrictions are correctly configured.
- If the check still fails, double-check your YAML for typos or missing registries in use by workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changes to Image configuration may take a few minutes to propagate in OpenShift. If the compliance check still fails after rescanning, wait a few minutes and run the scan again.
====

Well done! Updating allowed image registries is a great example of a quick compliance improvement you can implement in OpenShift. Other common hardening steps include enabling audit log forwarding or host node auditing with Linux auditd. These types of changes can be managed cluster-wide using the MachineConfig Operator, or automated at deployment time so new clusters are compliant out of the box—options include leveraging Ansible, ACM, or similar automation tools.

It’s important for Security and Operations teams to collaborate and ensure that clusters are provisioned with these baseline controls in place. Using the Compliance Operator and RHACS, you were able to test these configuration changes safely in our lab, validate that workloads continue to function as expected, and then propagate approved fixes into our broader operations and deployment workflows. This helps maintain continuous compliance across all environments.

== Who's Fixing What?

Managing on-premises and cloud environments can get complicated when determining responsibility for patching and maintaining platform components versus workload components. This separation of duties is critical for security operations and requires clear understanding of who owns what.

With cloud providers, they typically handle platform patching behind the scenes, which can obscure visibility into what's happening in your cluster. Their managed Kubernetes offerings are often minimal, meaning you're responsible for maintaining many components yourself. 

With OpenShift environments, Red Hat provides comprehensive operator-based management. Red Hat manages the operators and core platform components that you install, while you manage your application workloads. In general, vulnerabilities affecting Red Hat software components follow Red Hat's SLA for patching and remediation. This clear separation helps you understand exactly who is responsible for fixing what, enabling better coordination between platform and application teams.

=== The Workloads—Workload CVE Dashboard

More critical than fixing individual vulnerabilities is establishing a process to keep container images updated and prevent serious, fixable vulnerabilities from advancing through the pipeline.

Now it's time to focus on what matters most.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The numbers may be different in your environments. Changes to the lab enviornment and it's applications as well as vulnerabuility updates will alter the numbers.  
====

. Click the *Vulnerability Management -> Workload CVEs* tab

By default, you brought into the user workload tab now this contains all of the workloads that are considered your workloads. If you click on the deployment tab, you'll see Apache struts back on Atlas cart service other applications that we deployed. You'll also see some that slipped through the cracks for for example, example CERT manager or cluster manager add-on these are currently services that were not added to RHACS as part of the platform workloads now not to worry a simple command and API call can change this or or you can go to the platform configuration -> system configuration tab to change these details. For now, i've put together a quick script to move all of the services that are not part of the platform workloads into the user workload tab and vice versa

[IMPORTANT]
====
But default RHACS shows you critical and important vulnerabilities you can change this default in platform configuration or remove the filter. First, we recommend a quick read on https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/do-all-vulnerabilities-really-matter[Do all vulnerabilities really matter?]
====

[start=1]
. Run the following command to move some platform workloads into the correct tab.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
~/rh1-svc-lab/setup-files/add-layered-product-namespaces.sh
----

**OUTPUT**
[source,sh]
----
[LAYERED-PRODUCTS] Configuration updated successfully. Added 11 namespace(s) to layered products rule.
----

Now when you look at the workloads CVEs, they should contain all of the workloads that we deployed earlier in the lab. And they contain A LOT of critical and important vulnerabilities.

image::vuln-report-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Whereas the Platform CVEs contain only the platform workloads and their vulnerabilities and contain significantly less vulnerabilities.

Let's take a look at image signatures.

[start=2]
. Click the *Platform* tab, in the results section of Vulnerability Management. 
. Select the *Images* tab.

image::vuln-report-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

You should see a *Verified Signatures* label on every Red Hat image. This is because RHACS is verifying the signatures of the images that are pulled into the cluster. Since all Red Hat builds meet SLSA level 3 and are signed by Red Hat, they are verified by RHACS. Whereas the user workloads are not signed by Red Hat and are therefore not verified.

image::vuln-report-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Lastly, an easy way to export reports is to click the *Create report* button on the right side of the page and export what you are searching as a CSV.Try it out;

[start=4]
. Click the *Create report* button on the right side of the page.

image::vuln-report-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Click *Export report as CSV*

image::vuln-report-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]
. Click *Generate report*

image::vuln-report-06.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=7]
. Click *View status in reports table*

image::vuln-report-07.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=8]
. Download your generated report.

image::vuln-report-08.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Our goal is to make discussing vulnerabilities easy we recognize how many vulnerabilities there are in a container environment, and we want to limit that from a Red Hat platform standpoint and give you the tools to limit the vulnerabilities that you're deploying.

One of the ways we're doing that is with the new project hummingbird which designed to deliver modern software as hardened, verifiable container images. You can learn more about it here: https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/hummingbird[Project Hummingbird].
